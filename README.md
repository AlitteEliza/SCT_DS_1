# Task 01: Student Data Distribution Analysis

## Internship Task Overview
This project is part of my Data Science Internship at SkillCraft Technology.  
The objective of Task 01 is to analyze and visualize the distribution of categorical and continuous variables using bar charts and histograms.

## Objective
- Understand the distribution of students based on:
  - School type
  - Gender
  - Age
- Visualize categorical and continuous data clearly.
- Gain practical experience in data analysis and visualization.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains student-related information, including:

- School – Type of school (GP / MS)  
- Sex – Gender (Male / Female)  
- Age – Age of students (15 to 22 years)

This dataset is used to analyze demographic patterns among students.

## Visualizations Performed

### 1. School-wise Distribution
- Bar chart showing the number of students from each school type.
- Helps in comparing student populations.

### 2. Gender Distribution
- Bar chart representing male and female student counts.
- Provides insight into gender representation.

### 3. Age Distribution
- Histogram displaying student age distribution.
- Highlights common age groups and age spread.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Canva  

## Key Insights
- Most students belong to the GP school category.
- Gender distribution is nearly balanced.
- Majority of students are between 15 and 18 years old.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of fundamental data visualization techniques for analyzing categorical and continuous variables.

It improved my understanding of:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization methods
- Dataset interpretation
