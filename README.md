Task 01: Student Data Distribution Analysis
*Internship Task Overview
    This project is part of my Data Science Internship at SkillCraft Technology.The objective of Task 01 is to analyze and visualize the distribution of categorical and continuous variables using appropriate graphical techniques such as bar charts and histograms.
*Objective
    *To understand the distribution of students based on:
        *School type
        *Gender
        *Age
    *To visualize categorical and continuous data clearly using data visualization techniques.
    *To gain hands-on experience with data analysis and visualization tools.
*Dataset Description
    The dataset used in this task contains student-related information, including:
    *School – Type of school the student belongs to (GP / MS)
    *Sex – Gender of the student (Male / Female)
    *Age – Age of students (ranging approximately from 15 to 22)
    This dataset helps in understanding demographic patterns among students.
*Visualizations Performed
     *School-wise Distribution
         *A bar chart was created to represent the number of students from different school types.
         *This visualization helps compare student populations across schools.
    *Gender Distribution
        *A bar chart was used to show the count of male and female students.
        *It provides a clear comparison of gender representation.
    *Age Distribution
        *A histogram was created to visualize the age distribution of students.
        *This helps identify the most common age groups and understand age spread.
*Tools & Technologies Used
    *Python
    *Pandas – for data handling and analysis
    *Matplotlib / Seaborn – for data visualization
    *Jupyter Notebook / Python Script
    *Canva – for task presentation and documentation
*Key Insights
    *Most students belong to the GP school category.
    *Gender distribution is fairly balanced between male and female students.
    *The majority of students fall within the 15–18 years age range.
*Conclusion
    This task successfully demonstrates the use of basic data visualization techniques to analyze categorical and continuous variables.
    It helped strengthen my understanding of:
    *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    *Choosing appropriate visualization methods
    *Interpreting real-world datasets
